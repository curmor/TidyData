This is a code book describing the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

The data source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 
Original description of the dataset: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

Data Set Information
The experiments were carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person 
performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a 
smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 

The data
The dataset includes the following files:

README.txt

train/X_train.txt

train/y_train.txt

test/X_test.txt

test/y_test.txt

The following files are available for the train and test data. 

train/subject_train.txt

Transformation details
There are 5 parts:
1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

How  run_analysis.R  implements the above steps:â€¢Require  reshapre2  and  data.table  librareis.
Load both test and train data
Load the features and activity labels.
Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
Process the data. There are two parts processing test and train data respectively.
Merge data set.
